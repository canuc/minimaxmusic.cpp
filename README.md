# minimaxmusic.cpp

Local MiniMax Music 3 song generation server with browser UI, powered by GGML.
Lyrics and a structured caption in, complete stereo 44.1kHz songs out.
Runs on CPU, CUDA, Vulkan.

## Download models

Grab one GGUF of each type from Hugging Face and drop them in the
`models/` folder:

https://huggingface.co/Serveurperso/MiniMax-Music3-GGUF/tree/main

| Type | Pick one | Size |
|------|----------|------|
| LM | MiniMax-Music3-language_model-Q8_0.gguf | 9.1 GB |
| Depth decoder | MiniMax-Music3-rvq_depth_decoder-Q8_0.gguf | 690 MB |
| DiT | MiniMax-Music3-transformer-Q8_0.gguf | 2.6 GB |
| Condition encoder | MiniMax-Music3-condition_encoder-F32.gguf | 101 MB |
| VAE | MiniMax-Music3-vocoder-F32.gguf | 306 MB |

The LM also ships in BF16 / Q6_K / Q5_K_M, the DiT in F32 / Q6_K /
Q5_K_M / Q4_K_M, the depth decoder in BF16. The full quantized combo
runs in about 9 GB of VRAM, the full native set in about 29 GB.

Alternative: `./models.sh` downloads the default set automatically
(needs `pip install hf`), `./models.sh --all` everything.

## Build

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ServeurpersoCom/minimaxmusic.cpp.git
cd minimaxmusic.cpp
```

### Windows

To build from source, install
[Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
(select "Desktop development with C++" workload) and optionally the
[CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and/or the
[Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).

```cmd
buildcuda.cmd     # NVIDIA GPU
buildvulkan.cmd   # AMD/Intel GPU (Vulkan)
buildall.cmd      # all backends (CUDA + Vulkan + CPU, runtime loading)
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
./buildcuda.sh    # NVIDIA GPU
./buildvulkan.sh  # AMD/Intel GPU (Vulkan)
./buildcpu.sh     # CPU only (with BLAS)
./buildall.sh     # all backends (CUDA + Vulkan + CPU, runtime loading)
```

macOS auto-enables Metal and Accelerate BLAS with any of the above.

Native line-level lyric timestamps are an optional build feature. Add
`-DMINIMAXMUSIC_ENABLE_LRC=ON` to the CMake configure command, then request
them with JSON `"get_lrc": true` or CLI `--lrc`. The default is `OFF`, so
ordinary builds retain the existing FlashAttention-only binary and behavior.
Alignment uses the MiniMax LM's lyric attention and needs no extra model or
weights, but it runs the 36-layer AR attention path manually and is slower.

## Convert

To build the GGUFs locally from the official checkpoints instead,
download
[MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-Music3](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-Music3)
into `checkpoints/`. Only the five component subfolders and the tokenizer
are used; the rest of the repository (`qwen_7B/`, training checkpoints)
can be skipped.

```bash
pip install hf gguf numpy
./checkpoints.sh  # downloads the needed subfolders of MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-Music3
./convert.py      # native GGUF, byte-exact dtypes from the source, skips existing
./quantize.sh     # every quant from the natives, idempotent
```

| GGUF | Component | Size |
|------|-----------|------|
| MiniMax-Music3-language_model-BF16.gguf | global LM 8B (Qwen3) | 17.2 GB |
| MiniMax-Music3-rvq_depth_decoder-BF16.gguf | RVQ depth decoder 0.6B | 1.3 GB |
| MiniMax-Music3-condition_encoder-F32.gguf | condition encoder | 101 MB |
| MiniMax-Music3-transformer-F32.gguf | flow matching DiT 2.4B | 9.7 GB |
| MiniMax-Music3-vocoder-F32.gguf | flow VAE encoder + decoder | 306 MB |

## Run

```bash
./server.sh       # Linux / macOS
server.cmd        # Windows
```

Open http://localhost:8086 in your browser. The WebUI handles everything:
write a structured caption, set lyrics and duration, generate, play, and
download tracks.

Models are loaded on the first job (zero GPU at startup). By default the
server runs the strict VRAM policy: the LM stage and the synthesis stage
swap in and out per job, so the LM and the DiT never coexist. Pass
`--keep-loaded` to keep every model resident instead; switching one quant
in the UI then loads only that model, the others stay warm.

## Server options

```
Usage: ./mm-server --models <dir> [options]

Required:
  --models <dir>         Directory of GGUF model files

Server:
  --host <addr>          Listen address (default: 127.0.0.1)
  --port <N>             Listen port (default: 8086)
  --max-batch <N>        LM batch limit (default: 1)
  --max-seq <N>          LM KV cache size (default: model context)

Debug:
  --no-fa                Disable flash attention
  --no-batch-cfg         Split CFG into two separate forwards (LM + DiT)
  --clamp-fp16           Clamp hidden states to FP16 range
  --dump <dir>           Dump intermediate tensors
```

<details>
<summary>API endpoints</summary>

The server exposes one compute endpoint and a job system:

**POST /synth** - Submit a generation job (JSON MM3Request), returns a job
ID immediately. The single worker thread processes jobs in FIFO order.
The body must be sent with `Content-Type: application/json` (the HTTP
server caps urlencoded bodies at 8 KB).

**GET /job?id=N** - Poll job status. **GET /job?id=N&result=1** fetches the
result as multipart/mixed: one JSON replay request part (the request with
`audio_codes` and the exact seed of the track), one audio part, and—when
requested and successfully aligned—one `application/x-lrc` part per track.
For a single track, the same LRC is also base64 encoded in `X-LRC-Text` for
HOT-Step-compatible workers. MP3 or WAV is selected by `output_format`.
**POST /job?id=N&cancel=1** cancels a running job.

**GET /health** - Returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

**GET /props** - Available models per component, server version, default
request parameters.

**GET /logs** - SSE stream of server stderr.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full API reference
and MM3Request JSON specification.

<summary>CLI tools (advanced)</summary>

For scripting without the server, `mm-synth` runs the full pipeline.
Every rendered track gets its replay request written next to it
(`song.mp3` + `song.json`): the sampled codes travel in `audio_codes`,
and feeding that JSON back re-renders the same song with any synthesis
settings (models, steps, seed, CFG).

```bash
# quick one-shot
./build/mm-synth \
    --models models \
    --caption "Melancholic synthwave, slow tempo, analog pads" \
    --lyrics "[verse]..." \
    --lrc \
    --out song.mp3

# same request schema as the server
./build/mm-synth \
    --models models \
    --request /tmp/request.json
```

The `mm-lm` tool runs the autoregressive stage alone and writes the
same replayable request JSONs without synthesizing anything.

```bash
./build/mm-lm --models models --request song.json --out plan.json
./build/mm-synth --models models --request plan.json --out song.mp3
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full JSON
reference and the `neural-codec` (flow VAE audio codec, encode and decode, f32 and
reduced-bitrate Q8/Q4 latent formats), `mp3-codec` and `quantize` tools.

## Technical documentation

[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) covers the complete MM3Request
JSON reference, the five model components, the autoregressive and flow
matching inference recipe, quantization strategy, VRAM and model routing,
the parity and cosine similarity test suites, and architecture internals.
